## About The Project

- This project aims to give you real-world scenarios of manipulating the DOM.
- The functionality you will be using serves two purposes: to prepare you for appending dynamically added data to the DOM, and to show you how javascript can improve the usability of an otherwise static site.

      `document.getElementById` <br>
